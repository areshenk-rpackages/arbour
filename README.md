**arbour** is designed for convenient and reproducible project management from the command-line. The intention of the package (which is under early development) is to allow the user to easily create and maintain standardized directory structures associated with research projects involving large amounts of code, data, and figures.

The intended workflow is roughly as follows:

- Allow the user to create a complete directory structure according to the 
needs of a particular project.

- Document the function, inputs, and outputs, of individual .R code files using 
a simple header format.

- Compile summary reports detailing the large-scale code structure of a project.

A secondary function of the package is to encourage good research practices by
forcing the user to make use of a standardized workflow, and to document code
and data properly during the research process.
